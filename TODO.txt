Tagger
    -   Implement pass 1
    -   Verbos are missing conjugations
    -   Some nouns are missing plurals
    -   Solve homophone issue, ex. vivo(v) and vivo(adj)
    -   Separately process phrasals


 With regards to phrasals, at least those like connectors or prepositionals that
 start with some sort of word like those tagged in pass 1, perhaps the best approach
 would be having a set of 'trigger' words that would make the program halt at that particular
 word and look ahead to see if it matches any known phrases. Maybe each trigger can have a set of
 associated phrases that are then ruled out one by one as the tagger looks ahead. Either it finds
 a complete match or empties its phrase list and continues tagging.
    Also phrasals can be tagged with a special marker
    ex. "{$En cuanto a$} los ..."
    The only issue with this I foresee is that this could increase the time complexity considerably for long inputs.
